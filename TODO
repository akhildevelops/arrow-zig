## pretty
- [x] better slice append
- [x] better comptime params (structs)

## impl
- [x] null
- [x] fixed-size list
- [x] struct

## pretty
- [x] struct tagging?
	- no for now, but would look like https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1099#issuecomment-846404132

## impl
- [x] union
- [x] dict

## pretty
- [x] generic builder
	- [x] remove flat from list/union/dict

## impl
- [x] c
	- [x] integration test
	- [x] validity bitmask align(64)
	- [x] good abi
- [x] flatbuffers
- [-] ipc
	- [x] read
		- [x] safer
		- [x] error messages
		- [x] owned memory
		- [x] compression
			- [x] zstd
			- [x] lz4
		- [x] file dictionaries in wrong order
		- [x] true stream
	- [ ] write

## correctness
- [x] read all buffers for all tests
- [x] 64 bytes align
- [ ] investigate setNullable
- [x] why must all nullable struct fields be nullable?

## impl
- [x] more dict types
- [x] datetime types
- [ ] decimal types
	- wait for https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/15678
- [x] map type
- [x] fixed width binary type
	- [ ] add flat builder support
- [ ] c array import
